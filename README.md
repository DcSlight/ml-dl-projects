# Machine Learning and Neural Networks Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning and deep learning projects implemented in Python. Each folder includes a standalone project with code, explanations, and results.

## Projects

### üìÅ 1. `convolution`

**Handwritten Digit Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**  
Implemented and compared multiple neural network architectures on the MNIST dataset:

- Logistic regression (no hidden layers)
- Fully connected neural networks
- Convolutional neural networks with max pooling and dropout
- Achieved ~99% validation accuracy

[More details in the folder README](./Convolution/README.md)

### üìÅ 2. `lstm_language_modeling`

**LSTM-based Language Modeling and Next Word Prediction**  
Implemented multiple LSTM architectures to model and predict text sequences:

- Trained models with 1‚Äì2 LSTM layers in normal and reversed directions.
- Evaluated using perplexity metrics.
- Generated sample text and predicted next words.

### üìÅ 3. `xor_pytorch`

**House Price Prediction**  
Trained and evaluated multiple network configurations to learn the XOR function:

- Tested different learning rates, hidden units, and bypass connections
- Collected convergence statistics and analyzed neuron behavior
