# Titanic Survival Prediction – Advanced Models and Feature Selection

This project applies machine learning to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset using various classifiers and feature selection methods.

## Overview

- **Dataset:** Titanic dataset from Kaggle
- **Task:** Binary classification – survived or not survived
- **Platform:** All experiments conducted in a Kaggle Notebook

## Models Used

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

_One or more models were selected and compared._

## Feature Selection

Feature selection techniques applied:

- Forward Selection
- Backward Selection
- Hybrid Selection

_Features were selected using bootstrapped validation._

## Workflow

1. **Model Training**

   - Trained selected classifiers on the Titanic dataset.
   - Applied feature selection to identify most predictive variables.

2. **Evaluation**

   - Computed confusion matrices and KPI metrics (accuracy, precision, recall).
   - Visualized training vs. validation loss and accuracy.
   - Compared models and feature sets.

3. **Submission**

   - Generated predictions and submitted results to the Kaggle leaderboard.
   - Documented best submission and leaderboard ranking.

4. **Analysis**
   - Discussed which models and features performed best.
   - Highlighted insights and limitations.
